\section*{Introduction}

High Altitude Pulmonary Oedema (HAPE) is a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema associated with altitude, characterised by the triad of excessive pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), high protein permeability in pulmonary capillaries, and normal left heart function.\cite{Fred:1962hy,Roy:1969tt,Schoene:1988tz} Originally described by Houston in 1960, it remains a leading cause of preventable death at altitude, with an estimated mortality of 44\% if untreated, and 4--11\% if treated with descent and oxygen.\cite{HOUSTON:1960gz,Lobenhoffer:1982eg,MENON:1965gk} Whilst incidence is generally low -- 0.01\%, 0.2\% and 2\% at high, very high, and extreme altitudes respectively -- it increases dramatically with faster ascents.\cite{Bartsch:2002cg} As tourism to high altitudes approaches 40 million annually, the incidence of HAPE is likely to increase worldwide.\cite{West:ug}

It is now accepted that the ``stress failure'' model of pulmonary oedema described by West \emph{et al.} is most likely to represent the pathogenesis of HAPE in-vivo.\cite{Maggiorini:2001vq} This model hypothesises that an uneven Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstrictor Response (HPVR) occurs due to global hypoxia at altitude, causing uneven perfusion to the lung parenchyma. This results in markedly elevated pulmonary capillary pressures, causing mechanical failure of the capillary wall, allowing protein-rich fluid to leak from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli.\cite{West:1991vc,West:1995tg}

As excessive pulmonary artery hypertension appears to be a key step in the pathogenesis of HAPE,\cite{Maggiorini:2001vq,Swenson:2002ub} efforts have been focussed on modulating the HPVR for both prophylaxis and treatment of HAPE. Consequently, the calcium channel antagonist Nifedipine is widely used for this purpose, as an adjunct to descent and oxygen.\cite{Luks:2010ht}

\end{figure}

cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) presents an attractive therapeutic target, as PDE5 is abundantly expressed in the vascular endothelium of the pulmonary circulation.\cite{Ahn:1991vt} PDE5 catalyses the hydrolysis of cGMP to GMP, terminating the intracellular secondary messaging cascade from the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (Figure~\ref{fig:no-cgmp_pathway}).\cite{Archer:2009cx} Work in animal models suggests that by inhibiting PDE5, the effects of endogenous nitric oxide are potentiated, resulting in pulmonary vasodilation and a reduction in pulmonary artery pressure, thereby mitigating the key step in the pathogenesis of HAPE.\cite{Zhao:2001kj}

PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil and tadalafil -- well known for their role in erectile dysfunction -- have been in clinical use for over a decade. More recently, they have begun to be used in the treatment of chronic pulmonary hypertension.\cite{NationalPulmonaryHypertensionCentresoftheUKandIreland:2008jh}

\section*{Methods}

This literature review was guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methods.\cite{Moher:2009ew} A targeted search of the literature was conducted during June 2013 using the MEDLINE database. MEDLINE was initially searched using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keywords. However the closest term for HAPE was the supplemental concept ``Pulmonary edema of mountaineers [Supplementary Concept]'' and frequently was not associated with relevent papers. Hence, MeSH keywords were abandoned, and an alternative strategy was employed by searching directly for the terms ``High Altitude Pulmonary Edema''[\emph{sic}] and ``Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors''. To further broaden the search scope, the term ``High Altitude Pulmonary Hypertension'' was used synonymously for HAPE.

Additional primary research papers were identified through sources cited in recent meta-analyses and literature reviews in significant journals in the field.

Consensus guidelines, primary research articles and meta-analyses were included, whilst review articles, case reports and case series were excluded. Results were constrained to full-text articles and published in the last decade, but this latter clause was relaxed owing to the relative paucity of published research in this area.

\section*{Results}

A total of sixteen randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled trials, one open-label trial, one meta-analysis, and two recent consensus statements were identified using the search strategy described (Figure~\ref{fig:prisma}).

\end{figure}

Four studies were discarded as they were irrelevant to topic of HAPE or PAH (inappropriately indexed by MEDLINE), and another was excluded as it was an open label study. A further three studies transpired to be duplicates of previously identified studies and were likewise excluded. Studies included for qualitative synthesis are presented in the table below.

\section*{Discussion}

\subsection*{A review of the consensus statements}

The current 2010 Wilderness Medical Society consensus guidelines for acute altitude illness contain little regarding PDE5 inhibitors.\cite{Luks:2010ht} The sole recommendation is to suggest tadalafil for prevention of HAPE, though this recommendation is based on a single, small study (n=16).\cite{Maggiorini:2006kz} Surprisingly, the role of sildenafil is not discussed, despite the greater number of studies examining it in the literature.

Intriguingly, the 2008 UK national consensus statement on pulmonary hypertension does not include any guidance for prevention or treatment of either altitude-induced PAH or HAPE.\cite{NationalPulmonaryHypertensionCentresoftheUKandIreland:2008jh} However, when discussing treatment options for Idiopathic and Familial Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (IPAH/FPAH), the authors discuss the role of PDE5 inhibitors, concluding that they may be used as second-line therapy. This recommendation was derived largely from the results of the SUPER-1 study -- a large (n=278), multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial comparing sildenafil against placebo -- that demonstrated a reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and increased exercise tolerance.\cite{Galie:2005gx}

Whilst this study's subjects had IPAH and FPAH (\emph{cf.} high-altitude PAH), and was examining the effects of sildenafil over a 12 week period rather than acutely, it supports the earlier animal work by Zhao \emph{et al.}\cite{Zhao:2001kj} that PDE5 inhibitors do indeed reduce pulmonary artery pressures humans, implying that they may have a role in preventing HAPE.

\subsection*{Effects under normobaric hypoxia}

Relatively few studies (3/17) measured clinical HAPE as a primary endpoint -- perhaps owing to its relatively low incidence (2\%) in healthy adults\cite{Bartsch:2002cg}. Instead, most studies use elevated systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure (sPAP) as a surrogate endpoint for HAPE, given that it is a prerequisite step in its pathogenesis.\cite{Maggiorini:2001vq}

Further, measuring sPAP is non-trivial, as the ``gold-standard'' measurement remains Swan-Ganz catheterisation of the right heart, which is impractical in the setting of high altitude. Thus, some studies have sought to simulate altitude in a laboratory setting through normobaric hypoxia, to permit invasive measurement of sPAP.

Zhao \emph{et al.} used Swan-Ganz catheterisation to observe that a mean rise in sPAP of +9mmHg was almost abolished (+2mmHg) when healthy subjects were exposed to acute normobaric hypoxia (FiO\textsubscript{2}=0.11) when given 100mg Sidenafil 60 minutes beforehand.\cite{Zhao:2001kj}

Using a similar methodology, Kjaergaard \emph{et al.} reported a comparable attenuation in the rise of sPAP in response to normobaric hypoxia (Placebo: +10.9mmHg; Sildenafil: +3.6mmHg; FiO\textsubscript{2}=0.125).\cite{Kjaergaard:2007hp} However, they used echocardiography to measure the pressure gradient across the tricuspid valve during systole as an estimation of sPAP, which in addition to serving as an accurate surrogate, is also practical in non-permissive environments.\cite{Tramarin:1991uo,Allemann:2000tc}

Whilst both these studies reported encouraging results, both were small RCTs (n=10 and n=14 respectively), and further, as demonstrated in animal models, normobaric hypoxia is an inadequate simulation for altitude (hypobaric hypoxia) as pulmonary fluid balance heavily depends on barometric pressure.\cite{Bland:1977kz,Levine:1988uq}

\subsection*{Effects under hypobaric hypoxia}

Several studies have investigated the effects of PDE5 inhibitors on healthy subjects under hypobaric hypoxic conditions, and in general support the trend in attenuating the hypoxic-induced rise in sPAP found under normobaria.

Richalet \emph{et al.} took twelve subjects to 4,350m over 24 hours as part of a double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) and administered regular sildenafil \emph{after} arrival at altitude. Whilst observing the ``normal'' rise in sPAP associated with hypoxia, within 48 hours of commencing sildenafil this rise had been abolished, whilst it persisted within the placebo group.\cite{Richalet:2005el}

Ghofrani \emph{et al.}\cite{Ghofrani:2004gp} (n=14) and Reichenberger \emph{et al.}\cite{Reichenberger:2007bw} (n=28) conducted similar crossover, double-blind RCTs in 2004 and 2007 respectively. Using a slower ascent profile, they took subjects to 5,245m over seven days and administered a single 50mg dose of sildenafil shortly before measuring sPAP. They both reported a statistically significant reduction of 5mmHg and 7mmHg in sPAP respectively when compared to placebo.

Intriguingly, Faoro \emph{et al.} conducted a crossover, double-blind RCT (n=28) in 2007 that was unable to corroborate Ghofrani's and Reichenberger's findings. Again taking normal subjects to 5,000m over 10 days, and similarly administering a single 50mg dose of sildenafil shortly before testing whilst at altitude, no significant difference was found between placebo and sildenafil groups.\cite{Faoro:2007ji} However, when testing the same subjects under \emph{normobaric} hypoxia, a statistically significant reduction of 5mmHg in sPAP was observed in the sildenafil group.\cite{Faoro:2007ji}

All four of these studies were well-conducted RCTs, albeit relatively small. Unsurprisingly given their small numbers of healthy subjects, no cases of HAPE were recorded. The studies by Ghofrani \emph{et al.},\cite{Ghofrani:2004gp} Reichenberger \emph{et al.},\cite{Reichenberger:2007bw} and Faoro \emph{et al.}\cite{Faoro:2007ji} could be questioned in their value, given their relatively slow ascent profile (7-10 days) some degree of acclimatisation would have almost certainly occurred, and their regimen of a single dose of sildenafil shortly before testing is artificial and unlikely to be representative as to how it would be used prophylactically.

Richalet \emph{et al.}'s study\cite{Richalet:2005el} used the regimen of sildenafil perhaps most representative of ``real world'' use, and also used the most dangerous ascent profile (again, perhaps most representative of ``real life''!). Its methodology in commencing sildenafil after arrival at altitude and documenting reversal of the rise in sPAP in the intervention group \emph{and} a reduction compared to placebo is perhaps the most convincing evidence, and also tantalisingly suggests a role for treatment. Unfortunately, this study and Reichenberger \emph{et al.}'s\cite{Reichenberger:2007bw} were both funded by Pfizer which leads one to be cautious when interpreting positive findings.

\subsection*{Prophylaxis in HAPE-susceptible individuals}

As described in the literature, the three determinants for HAPE are altitude, speed of ascent, and individual susceptibility.\cite{Bartsch:2001kc,Bartsch:2002cg,Dehnert:2005ca} Of these, individual factors appear to be the strongest predictor of HAPE,\cite{Bartsch:2002cg} introducing the concept that there is a population of ``HAPE-susceptible'' individuals.\cite{Bartsch:2001kc,Dehnert:2005ca}. Evidence from recent studies suggests that for HAPE-susceptible individuals, PDE5 inhibitors may confer a benefit.

In 2006, Maggiorini \emph{et al.} conducted a double-blinded RCT comparing tadalafil against dexamethasone, and placebo, in preventing HAPE in susceptible individuals.\cite{Maggiorini:2006kz} The authors recruited subjects who had at least one previous episode of HAPE, and after commencing prophylactic medication 24 hours before ascent, took subjects to 4,559m for two days, ascending over 24 hours. Notably, this was the only RCT in the literature that used HAPE (diagnosed by either the Lake Louise clinical criteria\cite{Sutton:1991wx} or chest radiograph) as a primary endpoint.

Whilst in the placebo group, seven of nine subjects (78\%) developed HAPE, only one of eight subjects (13\%) in the tadalafil group was likewise affected. The rise in sPAP (measured with echocardiography) was also significantly blunted (p<0.05), supporting this trend: the mean rise in sPAP in the placebo group was 28mmHg, compared to 13mmHg in the tadalafil group.\cite{Maggiorini:2006kz}

A similar study conducted by Fischler \emph{et al.} in 2009 investigating exercise capacity in HAPE-susceptible subjects corroborated this finding. Using an identical regime of tadalafil, ascent rate, and altitude, HAPE was observed in seven of eight placebo subjects (88\%) compared to just one of seven tadalafil subjects (14\%). Likewise, Fischler \emph{et al.} reported a comparable statistically significant reduction in the rise in sPAP between tadalafil and placebo groups.\cite{Fischler:2009ce}

Both of these studies demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of HAPE in susceptible individuals with a regime of 10mg tadalafil b.d. commenced prior to ascent. Additionally, these studies also strengthen the correlation between an excessive rise in sPAP and the manifestation of HAPE.

However, both trials had small study arms, and Maggiorini \emph{et al.} note that they were unable to recruit their target of 18 subjects, as required by their power calculation. Furthermore, two subjects in their tadalafil group were withdrawn as they developed Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), but the authors undertook an intention-to-treat analysis which still demonstrated a significant difference between the groups. Therefore, in HAPE susceptible individuals PDE5 inhibitors do appear to confer a prophylactic benefit.

\subsection*{Prophylaxis in normal individuals}

Whilst no studies were identified that used HAPE as an endpoint in normal individuals, a recent study by Bates \emph{et al.} used elevated PAP as a surrogate endpoint.\cite{Bates:2011du} A relatively large double-blind RCT with 62 subjects, participants started taking regular sildenafil or placebo at sea level, ascending over four days to spend nine days at 5,200m.

Despite the large study, no statistically significant difference was found between placebo and sildenafil groups in sPAP, and no subjects developed HAPE. One could speculate whether a tachyphylactic phenomenon could be responsible for the discrepancy between this and other published trials, as this study was the longest to date, and sildenafil was started well in advance of ascent.

\subsection*{Strength in numbers}

A recurring theme to many of the discussed studies is their small samples. A recent meta-analysis was conducted by Jin \emph{et al.} in 2010, reviewing RCTs published before June 2009 on PDE5 inhibitors for high-altitude pulmonary artery hypertension.\cite{Jin:2010fc} They pooled data from ten studies, concluding that PDE5 inhibitors reduced sPAP by a weighted mean of 7.51mmHg. Notably, the authors employed Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis review methodology and only included studies whose methodology used hypobaric hypoxia (\emph{cf.} normobaric hypoxia), with all study altitudes >2,500m.

However, one study included in the meta-analysis had recruited participants exclusively from highland areas (2500--4000m) and was designed to look at the long-term effect of sildenafil, measuring results after a period of 3 months.\cite{Aldashev:2005fr} Another of the trials had only recruited ``HAPE-susceptible'' individuals i.e. patients who had previously had an episode of HAPE.\cite{Maggiorini:2006kz} Further, the wide variation in the studies' choice of drug (sildenafil or tadalafil), dosing regime, altitude, and crucially, speed of ascent to altitude, limit the utility of this meta-analysis' conclusions.

\subsection*{Lack of evidence for treatment of HAPE}

No studies were identified that investigated PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of HAPE, and the only evidence of their use remains anecdotal case reports. As such, the recognised treatment for HAPE remains immediate descent, oxygen, and nifedipine.

\subsection*{Potential pitfalls}

Like any drug, PDE5 inhibitors are not without risk. Concerningly, a common side effect of PDE5 inhibitors is headache, which is a cardinal sign of AMS. Furthermore, several studies reported a higher incidence of AMS, and in one, \emph{more severe} AMS, in groups receiving PDE5 inhibitors.\cite{Maggiorini:2006kz,Bates:2011du,Leshem:2012jq}. As discussed above, there is also a suggestion that PDE5 inhibitors may demonstrate tachyphylaxis which potentially reduces their utility as a prophylactic medication.\cite{Bates:2011du}

\section*{Conclusion}

There is a growing body of evidence from animal models, \emph{in vivo} human studies looking at surrogate endpoints, and RCTs that PDE5 inhibitors not only attenuate the rise in sPAP associated with global hypoxia at altitude, but also reduce the incidence of HAPE in susceptible individuals. However, the wide variation in regimes and doses of sildenafil and tadalafil by different studies makes it hard to generalise findings and to deduce rational guidelines suitable for the field.

Intellectually, they make for an attractive treatment for HAPE in place of nifedipine as they should cause less systemic vasodilation and consequently less risk of syncope in a hostile environment.\cite{JointFormularyCommittee:2013tz}

Currently, insufficient evidence exists to recommend the routine use of PDE5 inhibitors as HAPE prophylaxis for normal individuals. Their use as prophylaxis by HAPE-susceptible individuals is however supported. One regime supported by the literature is 10mg tadalafil b.d. At present, there is no evidence for the use of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of HAPE.

 Additional research is needed to better define the role, if any, of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with HAPE. This research question is ideally suited to a multi-center, crossover, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial with large study arms (n >200) of normal healthy individuals.
